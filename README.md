# simsim discord bot

blaseball, blaseball, is back! in an unofficial capacity. this is completely unaffiliated with the game band.

custom players, custom teams, custom leagues (that last one is coming soon‚Ñ¢) all set up in discord and watchable at https://simsim.sibr.dev, all powered by this bot and onomancer.
