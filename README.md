# matteo-the-prestige
# simsim discord bot

blaseball, blaseball, is back! in an unofficial capacity. this is completely unaffiliated with the game band 

custom players, custom teams, custom leagues (that last one is coming soon‚Ñ¢) all set up in discord and watchable at https://simsim.sibr.dev 

we've also got things like custom team creation, easy setup for your teams to play against each other, and player idolization, all powered by this bot and onomancer.

accepting pull requests, check the issues for to-dos.
