	- m;saveteam
	  - saves a team to the database allowing it to be used for games, send this command at the top of a list, with lines seperated by newlines (shift+enter in discord, or copy+paste from notepad)
		- the first line of the list is your team's name (cannot contain emoji)
		- the second is your team's slogan, this should begin with an emoji followed by a space
		- the next lines are your batters' names in the order you want them to appear in your lineup, minimum batters: 1, maximum batters: 12
